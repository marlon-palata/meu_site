Santiole Script is a playful yet regal lettering style that flourishes with a sense of celebration. Each letter carries a whimsical twist at its terminals, reminiscent of theatrical scrolls or festive signage. With a high contrast between thick and thin strokes, it radiates a strong personality while retaining a smooth flow across words.

Use underscore _ to make a swash under any word. 
Example: Rose_bud

Use multiple underscores to make different. 
Example: Super______man
